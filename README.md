# bilevel_anisotropic_regularization
This repository contains MATLAB files for spatially variant anisotropic regularization for lineat inverse problems.  
The codes accompany the paper: 

"Automatic nonstationary anisotropic Tikhonov regularization through bilevel optimization" - Gazzola and Gholami, arXive, 2024.

# Requirements
These codes requires L-BFGS-B-C: https://github.com/stephenbeckr/L-BFGS-B-C
